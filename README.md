## Design choices

Color choice is a neutral color to make user friendly Interface.
Used React because it creates more reactive response and it is faster.
used "module.css" because it is faster, and makes the code hard to break

## Challenges faced

- Had challenges making the UI more modern because there are no image URL from the API
-

## Thoughts on API

- Though the API documentation is great, but it should have Image URL to help with more suitable User Interface

-
